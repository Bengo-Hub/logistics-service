# Sprint 7 – Billing, Expenses & Subscription (Weeks 14-15)

**Status**: Not Started  
**Start Date**: TBD  
**Target Completion**: TBD

## Goals

- Implement usage metrics (tasks, km) with plan gating for advanced features.
- Build tariff system (base fare, per-km, per-minute, surcharges) with payout calculations.
- Create expense export to treasury (fuel/toll/parking/maintenance) with GL mapping and cost centers.
- Add receipts upload and mileage reimbursement support.

## Detailed Tasks

### 8.1 Usage Metrics & Plan Gating
- [ ] Usage tracking:
  - `usage_metrics` table: `tenant_id`, `metric_type` (tasks/km/api_calls), `period_start`, `period_end`, `value`, `limit` (from subscription)
  - Background job: aggregate daily/weekly/monthly usage
- [ ] Subscription integration:
  - Query treasury/auth-service for plan entitlements: `GET /v1/{tenant}/subscription`
  - Extract: `max_tasks_per_month`, `max_km_per_month`, `features[]` (advanced_routing, marketplace, analytics)
- [ ] Feature gating:
  - Middleware: `RequireFeature(feature string)` → check subscription
  - Block advanced features if plan doesn't include: return 403 with upgrade message
- [ ] Usage API:
  - `GET /v1/{tenant}/usage/metrics` → current usage vs limits
  - `GET /v1/{tenant}/usage/overage` → overage charges (if applicable)

### 8.2 Tariffs & Payouts
- [ ] Tariff profiles (`tariff_profiles` table, see ERD):
  - `name`, `base_fare`, `per_km_rate`, `per_minute_rate`, `surcharge_json` (peak_time/overnight), `is_active`
- [ ] Fare calculation:
  - `CalculateFare(ctx, task, tariffProfile)` → uses `route_metrics.actual_distance_meters`, `actual_duration_seconds`
  - Apply surcharges: check `requested_pickup_at` for peak/overnight
  - Store in `tariff_applications` table
- [ ] Payout calculation:
  - `earnings_statements` table: `fleet_member_id`, `period_start`, `period_end`, `gross_amount`, `net_amount` (after deductions), `bonus_amount`, `deduction_amount`
  - Background job: aggregate completed tasks per driver per period
  - Apply deductions: platform fee, penalties (SLA breaches, incidents)
- [ ] Payout export:
  - Emit `billing_events` to treasury: `event_type='payout'`, `amount`, `fleet_member_id`, `period`
  - Treasury processes payout via MPesa B2C or bank transfer

### 8.3 Expense Export to Treasury
- [ ] Expense ingestion:
  - `POST /v1/{tenant}/expenses` → accepts expense from logistics (fuel, toll, parking, maintenance)
  - Required fields: `route_id`, `vehicle_id`, `driver_id`, `category`, `amount`, `currency`, `cost_center`, `project`, `receipt_url`
  - Store in local `expenses` table (temporary) or emit directly to treasury
- [ ] GL mapping:
  - Category → GL account mapping (configurable per tenant)
  - Defaults: `fuel` → `Expenses:Vehicle:Fuel`, `toll` → `Expenses:Vehicle:Toll`
  - Treasury receives expense with `gl_account_code` for posting
- [ ] Cost center support:
  - `cost_center` field links to treasury cost center (for multi-branch reporting)
  - `project` field for project-based allocation
- [ ] Receipt upload:
  - `POST /v1/{tenant}/expenses/{id}/receipt` → upload receipt image (S3)
  - Store URL in `expenses.receipt_url`
  - Treasury can fetch receipt for invoice matching
- [ ] Mileage reimbursement:
  - `POST /v1/{tenant}/mileage-logs` → driver logs mileage (start/end odometer, route_id)
  - Calculate: `(end_odometer - start_odometer) * per_km_rate` (from policy)
  - Create expense automatically: `category='mileage_reimbursement'`
  - Export to treasury as expense

## Dependencies

- Sprint 2 complete (tasks exist for fare calculation)
- Sprint 3 complete (routes exist for distance/duration)
- Treasury service exposes expense/bill/journal APIs
- Auth-service exposes subscription entitlements

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Usage metrics are tracked accurately
- [ ] Feature gating blocks unauthorized features
- [ ] Tariffs calculate fares correctly with surcharges
- [ ] Payouts are calculated and exported to treasury
- [ ] Expenses are ingested and exported with GL mapping
- [ ] Receipts are uploaded and linked to expenses
- [ ] Mileage logs create reimbursement expenses automatically

## Next Sprint Preview

Sprint 8 will add reverse logistics (returns/exchanges), PoD upgrades (photos/NFC), compliance (GDPR, data retention), and safety features (no-go zones, HAZMAT).

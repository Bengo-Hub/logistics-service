## Logistics Service Delivery Plan

### Vision & Mission
- Orchestrate all mid-mile and last-mile logistics for BengoBox properties (food delivery, ecommerce, POS backoffice, inventory transfers) using a single, multi-tenant platform that shares the core `tenant_slug` and outlet registry with every Go microservice.
- Provide real-time visibility over riders/drivers, fleets, tasks, and service-level agreements while integrating tightly with inventory, POS, delivery apps, and treasury.
- Support a wide spectrum of flows: on-demand delivery, scheduled routes, batch consolidation, courier marketplace, third-party carrier integrations, and reverse logistics (returns, waste recovery).
- Offer subscription-aware features (advanced routing, marketplace integrations) aligned with tenant licensing.

### 1. Full Requirements
1. Functional modules:
  - Tenant & Fleet Management: tenants, fleets, rider/driver profiles, vehicles, capacity, compliance docs; shared `tenant_slug` and outlet IDs; tenant/outlet discovery webhook backfill.
  - Task Lifecycle: intake (cafe orders, inventory, POS, returns); FSM (created → assigned → en‑route → completed/failed); multi‑leg; SLAs; escalations; auditing.
  - Routing & Dispatch: on‑demand nearest driver; scheduled batches/waves; zone dispatch; optimization (TSP/VRP/VRPTW, pickup–delivery precedence, multi‑depot/multi‑day/split); manual override.
  - Real‑time Tracking & Telemetry: device/SDK/IoT location streaming; geofencing; route adherence; live ETAs and deviation alerts.
  - Proof of Delivery & Reverse Logistics: codes/signatures/photos/NFC, temp logs; returns/exchanges; audit trail.
  - Driver Behavior & Safety: ingest speeding/harsh/cornering/idling/unauthorised stops; driver scorecards; geofenced advisories; safety thresholds per tenant.
  - Expenses & Finance Hooks: capture fuel/toll/parking/maintenance/penalties per route/stop/vehicle; attach receipts; map categories to GL accounts; emit Expense/Bill/Journal to `treasury-app` with dimensions (tenant, route, vehicle, driver, cost center); support mileage reimbursements and inclusion in driver payouts.
  - Analytics & Intelligence: KPIs (on‑time %, distance, utilisation); heat maps; AI‑driven constraints (lateness/dwell/no‑show) folded into routing; what‑if simulation.
  - Subscription & Gating: plan‑based access (advanced routing/connectors/analytics); usage tracking (tasks, km).
  - Cross‑cutting: auth SSO + service‑level RBAC; multi‑tenancy; resilience; offline; compliance; observability.
-Route optimization details:
  - Inputs: time windows, service times, shifts/breaks, capacities/compartments/cold chain, skills/vehicle type, traffic‑aware ETAs, restrictions/LEZ, appointments, building access, cost models (fixed/variable, overtime/tolls/surge).
  - Objectives: minimize lateness/time/distance/cost; balance workload; maximize SLA.
  - Artifacts & safeguards: templates, zones/territories, waves, hubs/cross‑dock; adherence detection; exceptions; approvals.

### 2. System Analysis (Architecture, Integrations, Design)
- Architecture:
  - Gateway/API (REST + gRPC streaming), Dispatch Engine, Routing Service (OSRM/Maps), Telemetry Stream, Workflows/Saga, Notification Adapter, Integration Layer; PostgreSQL + Redis; Ent migrations; outbox to NATS/Kafka; OTel + Prometheus/Grafana; Docker/Helm/ArgoCD.
  - **Auth-Service SSO Integration:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Complete Go service implementation with `shared/auth-client` v0.1.0 library for production-ready JWT validation using JWKS from auth-service. All protected `/v1/{tenant}` routes require valid Bearer tokens. OpenAPI 3.0 spec updated with BearerAuth security scheme. Service scaffolding complete with HTTP server, configuration, logging, health endpoints, middleware, and infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, NATS). **Deployment:** Uses monorepo `replace` directives with versioned dependency (`v0.1.0`). Go workspace (`go.work`) handles local development automatically. Each service has independent DevOps workflows and can be deployed separately while sharing the auth library. See `shared/auth-client/DEPLOYMENT.md` and `shared/auth-client/TAGGING.md` for details.
- API surface:
  - `/v1/{tenant}/tasks|routes|fleet|carriers|proof`; bulk CSV import/export; public tracking `/v1/track/{code}`; webhooks (`logistics.task.*`, `logistics.rider.offline`, `logistics.carrier.failure`); provider registry `/integrations/providers` with encrypted configs; `/locks/access-windows|events`; `/incidents`; `/weather/forecasts`; safety `/telemetry/driver-events` and driver scorecards; route alternatives endpoints.
- Provider configuration & secrets:
  - Per‑tenant configs encrypted at rest (envelope/KMS); redacted reads; rotation/audits; precedence: env defaults → tenant overrides → feature flags.
- Integration context (capabilities & how):
  - Maps & routing: Google Maps Routes (traffic‑aware ETAs, restrictions/tolls), Roads Speed Limits (speeding context), Traffic incidents (where licensed) for accident/closure/hazard overlays and alt‑route prompts; OSM/OSRM for open routing (static traffic) with incident overlays from external feeds when needed.
  - Weather: OpenWeather One Call and/or Tomorrow.io for hyperlocal forecasts/alerts; open alternatives (Open‑Meteo, NOAA/NWS CAP). Weather adjusts ETAs and triggers alt‑route suggestions and advisories.
  - Smart locks: August/Yale cloud APIs (OAuth + webhooks), Nuki Web/Bridge API, and supported Schlage integrations; delivery unlock at destination by designated user (code/biometric/device) → PoD event + audit; manual override workflow.
  - Telematics: Samsara/Geotab APIs for driver events and vehicle diagnostics; scheduled ingestion with dedupe/backoff; enrich driver scorecards and ETA models.
  - Internal microservices: Treasury for payouts/surcharges/expenses; Inventory/POS/Cafe Backend for readiness/transfer hooks and state sync; Notifications for customer ETA and SLA alerts.
- Data model summary:
  - Tasks/Routes/Fleet/Telemetry/PoD/Integrations/Optimization/Safety/Access/Governance as described; include expenses linkage fields (route_id, vehicle_id, driver_id, category, receipt_ref) in events exported to treasury.

#### 2.5 Integration Points by Service

### 5. Provider Configuration & Secrets (Details)
- Per-tenant provider registry with the following categories:
  - Mapping & Routing: Google Maps (geocoding, traffic/incidents), OSM/OSRM (routing, tiles), Maptiler.
  - Weather & Hazards: forecast and alert providers (configurable).
  - Smart Locks: supported vendors with API credentials and capabilities metadata.
- All provider credentials are encrypted at rest with envelope encryption and redacted in API responses.
- Configuration schema includes: API keys, endpoints, toggle flags, cost preferences, rate limits, and fallback order.
- Audit trails for create/update/read of provider settings; periodic rotation jobs with alerting on failure.

### 6. Incidents & Weather in Optimization
- Incident and weather feeds adjust ETA matrices and edge weights dynamically.
- Hard constraints: closed roads/hard closures become no-go edges; soft constraints penalize heavy traffic/hazards.
- Dispatch reacts to events: re-insert stops, swap riders, or re-sequence routes to preserve SLAs.

### 7. Future Backlog & Enhancements
- Machine learning for demand forecasting, dispatch optimization, and dynamic pricing.
- Incentive engine for riders (gamification, bonuses).
- Drone/robot delivery connectors, EV fleet energy planning.
- IoT integrations (temperature sensors, door sensors) with alerts.
- Carbon footprint tracking, sustainability metrics.
- Marketplace API for external partners to plug-in tasks or capacity dynamically.

### 8. Immediate Next Steps
- Confirm ERD alignment with inventory/POS (shared concepts: warehouse, order IDs).
- Define contract-first API specs for cafe-backend and POS interactions.
- Validate mapping provider contracts, start reference implementation (Mapbox + OSRM fallback).
- Produce threat model (location spoofing, assignment fraud) and commence Sprint 0 after stakeholder approval.
